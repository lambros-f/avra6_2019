# Phylogeny of B. graminis spp. candidate effectors

In order to generate a phylogenetic tree for all the candidate effectors of sequenced B. graminis fsp IQ-TREE multicore version 1.6.beta4 for Linux 64-bit built Jun 21 2017 was used (command used: iqtree-1.6.beta4-Linux/bin/iqtree -m VT+R8 -s all_seqs.fa.aln -nt 12 -bb 1000). The initial alignment was generated using MAFFT v7.310 (2017/Mar/17) with the command "mafft --amino --6merpair --maxiterate 1000 --thread 12". The resulting tree was visualized using ITOL. The B. graminis formae speciales isolates used for the tree were: B. graminis fsp lolium, poae, secalis S1459, hordei DH14, triticale T1-20, tritici 96224. Annotation for these genomes were either obtained from https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1064-2#Sec21 or annotated denovo using the pipeline described in Frantzeskakis BMC genomics 2018.
